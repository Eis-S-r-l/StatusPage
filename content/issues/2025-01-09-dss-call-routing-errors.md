**Resolution Date of Incident:**

**Summary of Incident:**

Calls were not being correctly routed by the platform causing errors for both inbound and outbound calls.

The cause was a bug in a specific software version of the RTP Server that caused an OOM error.

**Mitigation Steps:**

1. Restarted the affected services

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Update the RTP Server to permanently fix the issue

**Action Items:**

* Improve our alerting system so that in the future we can take proactive action in similar cases
* Change SIP Server responses to SIP OPTION so that in similar cases customer endpoints will be able to correctly fail-over to the secondary node
